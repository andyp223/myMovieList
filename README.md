## Project Ideas
* __Movie Recommendation System__ (Selected)

The goal of this system is to create a movie recommendation system that could not only provide recommendations based on previous views/ratings, but also allow other users to recommend movies/genres to other users. Many platforms often provide one of these specifications, but it is often hard to find both of them in one, useable platform. The user would first interact with the platform by inputting previous movies watched/ ratings/ preferred genres etc. We would use these parameters to create a model which could create recommendations from a dataset (We are thinking a movie dataset can be obtained from online such as imbd.) Users would then have options to save these recommendations to a “watch later” list. Other specifications to this program would include recommending movies to other users, sharing lists with other users, etc. 

* __Pre-med Advising__

The purpose of this project is to connect Brown premeds and foster a collaborative community aimed at admission to medical schools across the country. There are two types of users: advisers and advisees. Advisers and advisees alike can register and input what courses they've taken, ethnicity, gender, GPA and MCAT if they wish, etc... They can prioritize a list of categories they're interested in eg. Practice material and notes, Looking for research opportunities, Connections to volunteer opportunities, etc... After inputting information, a list of suggestions is returned in the form of profiles (an extension of Autocorrect?) and prioritized in terms of similar courses, similar gender, similar ethnicity, similar people. The goal is to match the advisee with a mentor with a similar background in all areas who would be willing to help, answer questions, and provide resources for the advisee.

* __PDF Parsing__

The goals for this project is to develop and implement a natural language processing model in a useable and intuitive interface. Especially as college students, we are expected read and understand long, dense articles and textbooks to not only gain factual knowledge, but also a level of in-depth understanding as well. The PDF Parser would process the PDF and scrap it for the most useful information. The program would then release the summary of the PDF in a readable. Other options for the program would be an option to save summaries, a format in which to output practice “quizzes” in which the user could test themselves on their comprehension, etc.
